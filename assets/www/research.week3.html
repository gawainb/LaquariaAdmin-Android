            <h3>Week3 - Market Research</h3>
            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>games are the top. We love to play our games here in the U.S. Other categories include lifestyle and productivity. Currently, pages is in the top iOS apps sold. Facebook, twitter, and other social lifestyle apps are always among the top downloaded, although mainly free. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Japan is a bit of a interesting market. Although their top free apps are all games, if you look closer, you will notice that the top selling apps, and even free charts, is very crowded by productivity, handwritten note taking, and (my fav) comic book readers. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>This question raised my eyebrows a bit. The question asks for top selling which means the answer would be translation apps, games (of course), GPS apps, and utility apps. However, I looked a little deeper because that article was talking about Great Britain. The rest of the research I found on Great Britain says that the top "grossing" in Android are free games with in app purchases available such as Ice Age Village, Draw Something, and Zynga Poker. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Games are big, everywhere. They might not be as big on the surface of things, but they will always be. They are good time wasters. I also noticed that the 'busier' people like to buy more productivity and utility apps. Where the more 'artistic' and 'historical' societies likes the lifestyle apps. Lastly the U.S., I will keep most of my comments to myself, however I will note that we are all about games. Sometimes great apps like Pages makes the charts, but it is games most of the time. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>U.S.: 41.66%</li>
                <li>Japan: 44.18%</li>
                <li>Great Britain: 21.39%</li>
                <li>Knowing these stats are very important. Knowing the percentage of the latest and greatest will tell you the importance of getting your app updated or built with the latest and greatest before the OS hits the consumer markets. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>USA: cost=$.3.33 per 1mbps/bandwidth=4.8mbps</li>
                <li>Japan: cost=$0.27 per 1mbps/bandwidth=61mbps</li>
                <li>Great Britain: $10 to $20 per month for 1mbps /bandwidth=3+mbps</li>
                <li>It is super important to know your market this deep and to measure the same type of stats out of your app. For example, if your app uses a tremendous amount of data, then someone in the US would be very upset with you, while the folks in japan might expect it. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>My market choices would be US and Japan. My strategy though, would be to implement an app with a mini game included for micro breaks. The app would be very inexpensive on iOS and free for android. Both apps would include in app purchase content to increase the benefit and use of the app.</li>
            </ol>
