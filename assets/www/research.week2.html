            <h3>Week2 - Accessibility</h3>
            <p>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>There are quite a few ways you can personally help with accessiblity. You can use alt altributes on images, titles on ancors. Using new HTML5 tags instead of the generic divs are also a good way to enure the improvments of web accessibilty. If everyone started using header, article, footer, page, etc. then the programmers for accessibility apps would be able to improve their apps with that in mind.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Some common frustrations are companies that do not use image alt attributes properly and don't use a title attributes. To be honest actually, there is a lot of complaints. The accessibility market is very skewed and under developed in my opinion and it causes a very unsatisfying experience for those that need it. While watching the videos of people demoing these products, I was mainly going for those that needed it, and how they were using it. I saw a lot of talking under their breath, and them catching themselves and backing up, and restating things, just because the programs where hard to use. They were saying how wonderful these things were, but I heard the underlying complaints.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <ol>
                <li>1) The voices talk without expression and enunciation. These apps say quickly anything it can read on screen. It doesn't read it first and determine how it should say it, or if it should be said with the same tone. Essentially, these things are very unpersonal. </li>
                <li>2) The programs and devices are very expensive. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If I were to attempt to fix them myself, of course I would start with just auditing folks websites and sending out reports regoarding how the blind would hear their sites being read to them. I would also like to make a movement to start making everything more accessible to everyone. The best apps and such out there to help them out, can be better. Using them, and providing feedback and pushing to have them improved is the only way they will get better. If the developers don't get any feedback, they won't know how to improve what they built.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
                <li>Apple iPhone - It has text to speach and magnifying capabilities.</li>
                <li>HTC Evo - It has magnifying capabilities. a large screen, I can't remember if it has text to speach, i want to say it does. I do remember one of my favorites, it has a vibrate on button pushing so you know you hit a button feature.</li>
                <li>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
                <li>TALKS</li>
                <li>Some of the major US carriers have their own apps they deploy on smartphones for accessability, verizon and sprint to name a couple. These don't seemed to be named other then Accessibility</li>
