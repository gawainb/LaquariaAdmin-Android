            <h3>Week1 - Project Intent</h3>
            <p>Greetings everyone. Besides browser related features, HTML/CSS/JS alone cannot be used to implement native features. It must use a framework such as Phonegap. You can do things such as let the mobile browser know a phone number is being displayed, and they can press the phone number to open the phone app to place a call, and the same idea with email. However, you will not be able to say place a call from within your app. Native features such as the accelerometer, camera, compass, notifications, and contacts will need to be accessed using a framework such as PhoneGap.</p>
            <p>Pairing features to apps really depend on the app itself. The camera, notifications, storage, geolocation, file, and capture, all work pretty well across social media platforms as well as many other ideas. For instance, I created a new app for this class that I have been wanting to build for awhile. It is an aquarium enthusiast app that will allow you to search threw profiles of fish and offer some important tools in helping you build and maintain your own aquariums. Notifications can help me remind users that they need to run a water test, camera, file, media, capture, and storage can help the user interact with the site and save data locally to help the app run faster and more efficient. However, something like geolocation and accelerometer won't really help to much with anything.</p>
            <p>For my app, I plan to implement notifications, storage, capture, and camera at least as described above. Allowing users to be alerted of a water test, share pictures of their own aquarium, save fish profiles into their favourites and "tanks".</p>
            <p>I have learned many lessons by way of OOPS. First and foremost, ALWAYS look for timestamps on articles if reading a news site or blog. Articles can be old and outdated, if you find yourself on an older article, look to see if they have rewritten a newer one. I also like to look up the authors to see how credible they are. While you are reading and learning, look up up this idea, that person, the other option, write notes and keep them together. I like to use Evernote for this as I can search threw all of my notes on any machine I use. I can also share notes with others, and have collaborative notebooks within the program. Loosing information is almost as bad as not researching in the first place (you have to spend more time re-researching something you should of already had notes about).</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed this little tid-bit of information. I can't wait to see what you all have to say as well. Cheers!</p>
